# Developing Political Personas Through Generative Language Modeling

## Introduction
The main goal of politicians is to cater to their constituents and understand the changes they want to see. To do so, they need to be able to accurately identify their target voters, contact and survey them, understand their values and ideals, and predict which policies would best represent such populations. However, this process can often be time-consuming and expensive. Our project aims to help this problem.

Twitter data contains a wealth of information that contains public opinions on policies and politicians. By analyzing tweets from different political groups, we aim to create personas that mimic key voter groups using LangChain Agents and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo API. Our goal is to develop a model that can generate new data to predict real voting patterns based on previously posted tweets. We will then be able to ask these personas different political questions and explore their response and reasoning.
