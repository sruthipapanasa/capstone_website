# Developing Political Personas Through Generative Language Modeling

## Introduction
The main goal of politicians is to cater to their constituents and understand the changes they want to see. To do so, they need to be able to accurately identify their target voters, contact and survey them, understand their values and ideals, and predict which policies would best represent such populations. However, this process can often be time-consuming and expensive. Our project aims to help this problem.

Twitter data contains a wealth of information that contains public opinions on policies and politicians. By analyzing tweets from different political groups, we aim to create personas that mimic key voter groups using LangChain Agents and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo API. Our goal is to develop a model that can generate new data to predict real voting patterns based on previously posted tweets. We will then be able to ask these personas different political questions and explore their response and reasoning.

## Objectives
**Locate a Political Candidate’s Target Audience**:
Because our model can predict public opinion on political issues, candidates can figure out which voters align best with their policies in order to accurately target their campaign’s marketing efforts, which will help voters feel better represented by their leaders.

**Forecast Success of Political Candidates’ Policies**:
Candidates can ask our model to predict whether the exact policies they want to implement will gain favor or discontent from the public. They can use these responses to tailor their policies that will represent and benefit as many voters as possible.

**Address Limitations of Surveys and Cold Calling**:
Surveys and cold calling are very time-consuming and expensive. These traditional methods also have a low success rate as the average person may not take time out of their day to complete them. Our project addresses this problem.
